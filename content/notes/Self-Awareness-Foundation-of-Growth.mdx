**Core Idea:** Success starts with self-awareness. Before skills, effort, or opportunity, you need an accurate understanding of yourself: strengths, limits, values, origins, and areas to grow.

> **If you don’t know yourself, you can’t build yourself.**

**Why it matters:**  
Self-awareness is the source code of long-term growth. It's what you refine through journaling, reflection, entrepreneurship, and higher-self work.

**How to apply it:**
- • Identify your current strengths.
- • Identify non-negotiable limits or weaknesses.
- • Clarify your values and their origins.
- • Pick one area to intentionally improve this week.
- • End the week with a review question.
