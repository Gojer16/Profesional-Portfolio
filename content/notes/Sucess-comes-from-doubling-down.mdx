**Core Idea:**  
You win by focusing on your strengths, not by endlessly patching weaknesses. Success comes from doubling down on what you naturally do exceptionally well.

**Essence:**  
Your edge is your engine. One or two world-class skills create disproportionate results. Being "balanced" often means being average.

## How to apply it

### **1. Identify Your Edge**
Ask:
- • What can I do at a level most people can't?
- • What energizes me even when it's hard?
- • What do people naturally come to me for?

### **2. Build Around Your Edge**
- • Prioritize projects where that skill matters
- • Use deliberate practice to sharpen it
- • Delegate anything outside your strengths

### **3. Create a Habit of Amplification**
Weekly questions:
- • "What did I do that used my strengths?"
- • "How can I do more of that next week?"

### **4. Build Identity Around Your Spike**
Let your strengths shape:
- • Your path
- • Your business decisions
- • Your learning
- • Your environment
- • Your collaborations
